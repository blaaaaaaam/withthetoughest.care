              <em>With the toughest care, The most economical tenderness</em> is
              an artwork shipped to you, where you can register to receive a
              package containing a vial of scented oil.
            </p>
            <p>
              Distilled by hand using a process which Justine Youssef inherited
              matrilineally, the scented oil is made of the Blessed Milk Thistle
              (Silybum marianum), a therapeutic plant native to Lebanon that
              becomes invasive under certain climates. First introduced by
              settlers to Maui, Hawai‘i for medicinal use, the plant quickly
              eluded cultivation and its presence is now considered highly
              noxious in the Makawao area.
            </p>
            <p>
              The work is in dialogue with the scent-related artefacts that have
              been uprooted from Greater Syria and housed at the Shangri La
              Museum of Islamic Art, Culture &amp; Design in Honolulu. The scent
              of Blessed Milk Thistle unfolds both a space to interrogate
              histories of settler relationships to land, and a portal to access
              traces of the plant’s restorative properties, knowledge of which
              has become erased through displacement.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>With the toughest care, The most economical tenderness</em>
              moves through routes similar to early colonial ships, via ruptured
              supply chains from Dharug Land in Sydney, Australia, where the
              plant was harvested and is equally invasive. It takes its name
              from Judith Wright’s
              <em>The Eucalypt and the National Character</em>, a poem that
              co-opts a native plant and likens it to the settler Australian
              identity.

              According to the Marine Exchange of Southern California, there are
              currently 96 ships waiting to enter the port of Ke Awa O Kou.
              Record numbers of goods destined for Hawai‘i remain bottlenecked
              in congested air cargo shipping pipelines. While supply chain
              delays are attributed to COVID-19, the extractive systems of rapid
              worldwide shipping have been under stress long before the global
              pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project imagines that the Blessed Milk Thistle, with its
              anti-inflammatory properties, might ease congestion as its scent
              travels through backed up supply chains from Dharug Land to across
              Hawai‘i.

              It is impossible for locusts to penetrate the thorns of plants.
              When swarms invaded Lebanon, Palestine and Syria during World War
              1, the Blessed Milk Thistle was one of few species spared. Famine
              ensued, though the plant sustained those who learned to cut,
              shave, and boil its roots, stems, and bulbs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The white veins of the Blessed Milk Thistle were first coloured in
              Mount Lebanon. A drop of the Virgin Mary’s breast milk leaked onto
              its leaves, imbuing the plant with anti-inflammatory and
              regenerative properties. All parts of the plant, from root to
              seed, became edible and beneficial.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lactating mothers often ate the plant raw to boost breast milk
              production. Others boiled its leaves to read their future in the
              steam, and burned its seeds for protection. So sought after for
              its medicine, the plant developed prickles along its stems and the
              flat side of its leaves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Safer from consumption, it learned to thrive in disturbance,
              making it impossible to eradicate and noxious when displaced.
            </p>
            <p>
              Across waters, impenetrable thickets of the Blessed Milk Thistle
              spread over Maui when the plant was first cultivated by occupiers
              in the late 1800s. It smothered pastures, and suffocated the
              cattle consuming its potassium rich leaves, until it was listed as
              a prohibited species.
            </p>
            <p>
              Burning the plant, or disturbing the soil within which it grew,
              only encouraged germination. To kill the plant for good, one had
              to cut and bag all seed and flower heads at summer’s end, and
              repeat this for nine years straight.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bags were buried deep into the site of its displacement in an
              attempt to halt its growth, though it continued to sprout and
              spread in secret. It has since become naturalised across the
              Makawao area—disguised as other benign species, with its medicine
              no longer accessible.

              Justine Youssef works across mediums from scent to video, having
              recently exhibited
              <em>Under the table I learnt how to feed you</em> at the Museum of
              Contemporary Art, Sydney (2022); <em>Lovesick Puppy</em> with Utp
              (2021); and <em>All Blessings, All Curses</em> at 4A Centre for
              Contemporary Asian Art, Sydney (2018). They have exhibited widely,
              with spaces such as CARPARK, Brisbane (2021); PHOTO 2020,
              Melbourne (2020); and Salamanca Arts Centre, Hobart (2020). Their
              work has been published with IchikawaEdward &amp; no more poetry,

              They live across unceded Wangal and Dharug lands in Sydney,
              Australia where they were a Parramatta Artist Studios resident
              from 2019-2021 and the 2019 recipient of the Copyright Agency’s
              John Fries Award. They were co-director at Firstdraft, co-founded
              the artist-run space Pari, and have organised various educational
              programs for the National Association for the Visual Arts.
              <em>With the toughest care, The most economical tenderness</em>
              was created for the Hawai‘i Triennial 2022, and marks Youssef’s
              first work made in response to a site they have never visited
              overseas.
